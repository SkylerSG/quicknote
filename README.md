# QuickNote

A fast, small desktop app designed to invisibly record keystrokes upon hotkey (CTRL+3). Useful for random thoughts or (in my case) to-do lists, etc.

Add a shortcut for it to the 'Startup' folder at Win+R -> shell:startup. Right now, the text is placed in the app directory, but this will probably change later.
